# The Philosophy

## Why We Built Stack'd

Inflation is the silent thief. Every year, it erodes your purchasing power—quietly eating away at your savings while prices climb higher. We built Stack'd because we believe there's a better way.

**Gold and Bitcoin are protection.** They're scarce, verifiable, and have historically preserved wealth when fiat currencies lose value. Holding these hard assets is how you inflation-proof your life.

### The Dilemma

We've all been there: You have savings in Gold or Bitcoin, but you need cash for something important.

*   **If you sell**, you solve the immediate problem, but you weaken your long-term financial shield. You have less of the asset that protects you from inflation.
*   **If you don't sell**, you might struggle to afford today's expenses.

This forces a painful choice between your present well-being and your future wealth.

### The Third Option: Liquidity Without Selling

The wealthy have used this strategy for decades: **"Buy, Borrow, Die."** They buy assets, borrow against them to fund their lifestyle, and never sell the principal.

Stack'd brings this strategy to everyone. If you hold Bitcoin or Gold, you can access this same financial superpower.

*   You keep 100% of the asset appreciation.
*   You access the cash you need today.
*   You avoid the taxable event of selling.

We built Stack'd to help you hold onto your hard assets, wait out the inflation storm, and come out the other side with your purchasing power intact.
