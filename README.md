# Welcome to Stack'd

## Inflation-Proof Your Life

**Imagine life without inflation.**

You don't have to sell your Gold or Bitcoin holdings to pay for life's expenses. Stack'd lets you borrow cash against your hard assets—without giving them up.

Stack'd is a secure financial tool that allows you to borrow cash (USDT) against your Gold or Bitcoin collateral without selling the underlying asset. Access the liquidity you need for real-world expenses while your assets continue protecting your purchasing power.

### The Problem
When you need cash for expenses—like a car, a home renovation, or just daily living—you usually have to sell your assets. 
*   **Selling means taxes**: You trigger a taxable event (Capital Gains).
*   **Selling means missing out**: You lose the potential future upside of that asset.
*   **Selling means inflation wins**: You exchange hard assets for depreciating fiat currency.

### The Stack'd Solution
Instead of selling, you lock your assets in a secure, audited smart contract on the Arbitrum network and borrow stablecoins (USDT) against them.
*   **No Capital Gains Tax**: Borrowing is not a taxable event in many jurisdictions (check with your tax advisor).
*   **Keep the Upside**: You still own your Gold and Bitcoin. If the price goes up, your portfolio grows.
*   **Flexible Repayment**: No monthly payments. Pay back the loan whenever you want to unlock your collateral.

### Is it Safe?
Security is our #1 priority. Stack'd is built on top of the battle-tested **Compound V3** protocol, one of the oldest and most secure DeFi protocols in existence.
