## Beat Inflation. Keep Your Assets.

**You don't have to sell your Bitcoin to live your life.**

Stack'd is a secure financial tool that allows you to borrow cash (USDT) against your Bitcoin or Gold collateral without selling the underlying asset. This enables you to access liquidity for real-world expenses while maintaining your long-term position in hard money assets that have historically outperformed inflation.

### The Problem
When you need cash for expenses—like a car, a home renovation, or just daily living—you usually have to sell your assets. 
*   **Selling means taxes**: You trigger a taxable event (Capital Gains).
*   **Selling means missing out**: You lose the potential future upside of that asset.
*   **Selling means inflation wins**: You exchange hard investments for depreciating fiat currency.

### The Stack'd Solution
Instead of selling, you **Stack** your assets in a secure, audited smart contract on the Arbitrum network. You then borrow stablecoins (USDT) against them.
*   **No Capital Gains Tax**: Borrowing is not a taxable event in many jurisdictions (check with your tax advisor).
*   **Keep the Upside**: You still own the Bitcoin/Gold. If the price goes up, your portfolio grows.
*   **Flexible Repayment**: No monthly payments. Pay back the loan whenever you want to unlock your collateral.

### Is it Safe?
Security is our #1 priority. Stack'd is built on top of the battle-tested **Compound V3** protocol, one of the oldest and most secure DeFi protocols in existence.
