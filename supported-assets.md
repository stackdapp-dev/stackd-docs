# Supported Assets

Stack'd currently supports two premium collateral assets on the **Arbitrum** network.

## 1. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)
**"The Gold Standard of Crypto"**

*   **What is it?** WBTC is an ERC-20 token that is 1:1 backed by real Bitcoin. It allows you to use Bitcoin on the Ethereum and Arbitrum networks.
*   **Why we support it:** Bitcoin is the most liquid and secure digital asset in the world. It is the perfect collateral for long-term loans.
*   **Arbitrum Contract:** `0x2f2a2543B76A4166549F7aaB2e75Bef0aefC5B0f`

## 2. Tether Gold (XAUT)
**"Digital Gold"**

*   **What is it?** Tether Gold (XAUT) is a digital asset where one token represents ownership of one fine troy ounce of physical gold held in a Swiss vault. Each XAUT token is backed by gold meeting the London Good Delivery standard.
*   **Why we support it:** Gold has been the ultimate store of value for 5,000 years. It is stable, universally recognized, and a classic hedge against inflation. XAUT provides the security of physical gold with the convenience of a digital token.
*   **Arbitrum Contract:** `0x68749665FF8D2d112Fa859AA293F07A622782F38`

## Why these two?
We only accept **Hard Assets**—assets that are verifiable, scarce, and historically provenance as stores of value. We do not accept volatile "meme coins" or unproven utility tokens as collateral, because they introduce too much risk for you (liquidation risk) and the protocol.
