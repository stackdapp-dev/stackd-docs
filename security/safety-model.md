# Safety Model

Your trust is everything. Here is how we secure your assets.

## 1. Non-Custodial
**"Not your keys, not your coins."** We take this seriously. 
*   Stack'd is **non-custodial**. We do not have a user database with your passwords. We do not hold your funds in a company bank account.
*   Your assets live in a **Smart Contract** on the blockchain. Only YOU can withdraw them (provided you don't have bad debt).
*   Even if the Stack'd team disappears tomorrow, your funds remain on the blockchain, retrievable by interacting directly with the contract.

## 2. Built on Giants
We did not reinvent the wheel. Stack'd is a fork of **Compound V3**, one of the most battle-tested protocols in DeFi history.
*   Compound has secured billions of dollars in assets for years.
*   By using their proven code architecture, we inherit their rigorous security standards.

## 3. Audits
Our smart contracts are open-source and verifiable. (Insert Audit Links Here once available).

## 4. Price Feeds
We use **Chainlink** or equivalent decentralized oracles for price data. This prevents "flash loan attacks" or price manipulation that could falsely liquidate you.
