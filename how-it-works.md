# How It Works

The process is simple and completely non-custodial. You are always in control of your assets.

## The Cycle

The Stack'd workflow consists of four main steps:

### 1. Deposit Collateral
You deposit your **WBTC** (Wrapped Bitcoin) or **XAUT** (Tether Gold) into the Stack'd Protocol on the Arbitrum network. 
*   This locks the asset into a secure Smart Contract.
*   You can withdraw it at any time, as long as you don't have an outstanding loan that exceeds the safety limit.

### 2. Borrow USDT
Based on the value of your collateral, the protocol gives you a "Borrow Limit." You can borrow **USDT** (Tether) up to ~80% of your collateral's value (though we recommend keeping it lower for safety).
*   The USDT is sent directly to your wallet immediately.
*   No credit checks. No paperwork. The collateral *is* your credit.

### 3. Use the Cash
You can now use that USDT however you like. 
*   Send it to an exchange to cash out to your bank account.
*   Spend it directly with crypto debit cards.
*   Use it for other investments.

### 4. Repay & Unlock
There is **no monthly repayment schedule**. You can pay back the loan in 1 day or 10 years.
*   Interest accrues automatically on the balance.
*   When you are ready, you pay back the borrowed USDT + interest.
*   Once the debt is paid, your collateral (BTC/Gold) is unlocked and available for you to withdraw.

## Example Scenario

1.  **Start**: You have **1 WBTC** worth **$100,000**. You need **$20,000** for a home repair.
2.  **Deposit**: You deposit 1 WBTC into Stack'd.
3.  **Borrow**: You borrow **$20,000 USDT**. Your "Loan-to-Value" (LTV) is 20%, which is very safe.
4.  **Wait**: One year later, Bitcoin price doubles to **$200,000**.
5.  **Repay**: You pay back the **$20,000 USDT** plus interest (e.g., ~$1,000). Total cost: $21,000.
6.  **Withdraw**: You withdraw your **1 WBTC**. 
7.  **Result**: You still own 1 WBTC, which is now worth **$200,000**. You effectively paid $1,000 in interest to gain $100,000 in asset appreciation.

If you had sold the $20,000 of BTC at the start, you would have lost out on that growth.
