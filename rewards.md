# Rewards Program

Earn passive income by inviting friends to Stack'd.

## How it Works
The Stack'd Rewards Program is simple: **You earn a commission every time your referrals pay interest on their loans.**

*   **Commission Rate**: You earn **10%** of the interest paid by people you refer.
*   **Payout**: Rewards are paid in **USDT**.
*   **Claiming**: You can claim your earnings to your wallet at any time.

This is not a one-time bonus. As long as your friends have an active loan and are accruing interest, you are earning rewards. It is a true passive income stream.

## Example Walkthrough

Let's look at how much you could earn.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor You
    actor Alice
    participant Protocol as Stack'd Protocol

    You->>Alice: Share Referral Link
    Alice->>Protocol: Connect Wallet
    Note over Protocol: Protocol links Alice to You

    Alice->>Protocol: Deposit 1 BTC
    Alice->>Protocol: Borrow $20,000 USDT
    
    Note over Protocol: Time Passes...<br/>Interest Accrues ($1,000)

    Protocol->>You: Pay $100 USDT (10% Reward)
    Protocol->>Protocol: Collect Remaining Interest
```

### 1. The Setup
*   **You** invite your friend **Alice** using your unique referral link.
*   Alice connects her wallet. The protocol now links her wallet to yours forever.

### 2. The Loan
*   Alice deposits 1 BTC and borrows **$20,000 USDT**.
*   The interest rate (APR) is **5%**.

### 3. The Interest
Over the course of one year, Alice's loan accrues interest:
*   $20,000 * 5% = **$1,000** in total interest for the year.

### 4. Your Reward
When Alice repays her interest (or as it accrues), the protocol calculates your share:
*   Your Share = 10% of Interest
*   **You earn $100 USDT.**

### Scale it up
If you invite **10 friends** like Alice, you would earn **$1,000 / year** just for introducing them to the platform.
