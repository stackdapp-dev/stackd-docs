# Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there a minimum deposit?
No, but bear in mind that gas fees (transaction fees) apply. Depositing $5 might cost $0.10 in gas, so it is better to stack meaningful amounts.

### What is the interest rate (APR)?
The interest rate fluctuates based on supply and demand (market utilization). 
*   If many people are depositing and few are borrowing, rates are low (e.g., 2%).
*   If everyone is borrowing, rates go up (e.g., 8%).
Check the **Borrow APR** on the dashboard for the real-time rate.

### Is there a lock-up period?
No. You can deposit and withdraw in the same minute if you want. You are never locked in.

### What happens if Bitcoin crashes to zero?
If Bitcoin goes to zero, your collateral is worth zero. The protocol would have liquidated your position on the way down to cover the loan. You would keep the USDT you borrowed, but you would lose the Bitcoin. 
*This is why we recommend secure, historically proven assets like BTC and Gold.*

### How do you make money?
Stack'd takes a small "Reserves" cut of the interest paid by borrowers. This goes into a communal insurance fund for the protocol.
