# Guide: Depositing Assets

Follow this guide to securely lock your Bitcoin or Gold into the Stack'd Protocol.

## Prerequisites
*   You need a Web3 Wallet (like **MetaMask** or **Rabbit**).
*   You need some **ETH (Arbitrum)** in your wallet to pay for transaction fees (gas). Gas on Arbitrum is very cheap (usually < $0.10).
*   You need **WBTC** or **XAUT** on the Arbitrum network.

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Connect your Wallet
Go to the Stack'd App and click **Connect Wallet**. Select your wallet provider.

### 2. Navigate to "Deposit"
On the main dashboard, you will see your wallet balances. Click the **Deposit** button next to the asset you want to stack (e.g., WBTC).

### 3. Grant Permission (Approve)
If this is your first time using Stack'd, you will need to "Approve" the protocol to access your token.
*   Click **Approve**.
*   Confirm the transaction in your wallet.
*   *Note: This does not move your funds yet. It just gives permission.*

### 4. Enter Amount & Confirm
*   Enter the amount you want to deposit (e.g., `0.5 WBTC`).
*   Click **Supply**.
*   Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

### 5. Success
Once the transaction confirms (usually 1-2 seconds on Arbitrum), you will see your "Collateral Balance" update on the dashboard.

**Congratulations! You have now Stack'd your assets.** You are ready to borrow.
