# Guide: Repaying Loans

You can pay back your loan at any time. There are no prepayment penalties.

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Go to "Repay"
On the dashboard, find your outstanding "Borrow Balance." Click **Repay**.

### 2. Grant Permission (USDT)
You need to allow the protocol to take USDT from your wallet.
*   Click **Approve USDT**.
*   Confirm in your wallet.

### 3. Enter Amount
*   You can choose to repay **Part** of the loan or **All** of it.
*   If you repay *All*, you will pay the principal + any accrued interest.

### 4. Confirm Payment
*   Click **Repay**.
*   Confirm in your wallet.

### 5. Unlock Collateral
Once the loan is repaid, your "Available to Borrow" limit goes back up, and you are free to withdraw your collateral back to your wallet if you wish.
