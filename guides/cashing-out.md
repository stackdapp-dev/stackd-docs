# Guide: Cashing Out

You've borrowed USDT. Now, how do you turn it into "real money" to pay your bills?

Stack'd is a decentralized protocol, so we don't have a direct bank transfer feature *yet*. However, moving from DeFi to your bank is easy.

## Option 1: Centralized Exchange (Coinbase, Kraken, Binance)
This is the most common method.
1.  **Send USDT**: Send your borrowed USDT from your Web3 wallet to your exchange deposit address (make sure to select the **Arbitrum** network if supported, or bridge to Ethereum first).
2.  **Sell**: Sell the USDT for USD/EUR/GBP.
3.  **Withdraw**: Withdraw the fiat currency to your linked bank account.

## Option 2: Crypto Debit Cards
Use a card like **Crypto.com**, **Coinbase Card**, or **BitPay**.
1.  Top up your card balance with the borrowed USDT.
2.  Swipe the card at any store or use it for online purchases.

## Option 3: P2P Markets
Use platforms like **Bisq** or **RoboSats** if you prefer more privacy, though liquidity for USDT might vary.
