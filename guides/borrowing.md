# Guide: Borrowing Cash

Once you have deposited collateral, you can borrow USDT against it instantly.

## Understanding Borrow Limits
*   **Collateral Value:** The total dollar value of your Stack'd assets (e.g., $50,000).
*   **Borrow Capacity:** The maximum you *can* borrow (usually 80% of collateral).
*   **Safe Limit:** The amount you *should* borrow to stay safe (we recommend < 50%).

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Go to "Borrow"
On your dashboard, you will see your "Available to Borrow" limit. Click the **Borrow** button.

### 2. Enter Amount
Type in how much USDT you want to borrow.
*   Watch the **Health Factor** bar. 
    *   **Green**: Safe (Low risk of liquidation).
    *   **Yellow**: Caution (Monitor closely).
    *   **Red**: DANGER (High risk).

### 3. Confirm Transaction
*   Click **Borrow USDT**.
*   Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

### 4. Receive Funds
The USDT is sent directly to your wallet instantly. There is no waiting period.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Keep an eye on your Health Factor!** If the price of Bitcoin drops significantly, your collateral value drops. If it drops too low, you might be liquidated. Always borrow less than the maximum to leave a safety buffer.
